      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “The road is known and understood by those who have travelled it before.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This belief is central to how we support our students. Academic challenges
        are best addressed by individuals who have already navigated similar paths.
        For this reason, we work with top-achieving university students for school-level
        tutoring, and strong graduates for both university and school students.

        for students and parents.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility:</strong> Continuous adjustment of teaching strategies based on student progress.</li>

      <h2>Monitoring & Progress Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        Frequent assessments are used to track student progress and identify challenges early.
        This allows us to intervene proactively, helping prevent future poor academic performance.
        Feedback is structured and aligned with the level of support required by each student.

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section class="section section-dark has-bg fade-in">
 <div class="support-blue-wrapper">
  <div class="container-bg">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Our process is designed to ensure clarity, accountability, and the right academic support
      from the very beginning.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Review Our Tutors</h3>
    <p>
      Clients are required to first review our available tutors, including their qualifications,
      experience, and subject expertise. This ensures an informed and suitable tutor selection.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Submit a Request for Assistance</h3>
    <p>
      Once a tutor has been selected, the client completes a request form providing the student’s
      academic level, subject, required support type, availability, and other relevant details.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Receive a Quotation or Lesson Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Based on the submitted request, a quotation is sent to the client via email.
      Alternatively, a lesson plan may be provided where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Begin with Pay-Per-Lesson</h3>
    <p>
      New clients are encouraged to start with a pay-per-lesson approach. This builds integrity
      and mutual trust. With time and consistency, clients may transition to monthly arrangements.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Lessons, Monitoring & Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Lessons are conducted either online or in person. Regular assessments are used to monitor
      progress, with feedback provided on a session, weekly, or monthly basis depending on the
      selected support type.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6: Reminders & Ongoing Support</h3>
    <p>
      Reminders are sent less than 24 hours prior to scheduled lessons. Ongoing monitoring allows
      for early intervention, ensuring that academic challenges are addressed before they escalate.
